## Hi there 👋
📊 EMI Calculator (Python)

This is a simple Python-based **EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Calculator**. It calculates the monthly EMI, total interest, and total payment for a loan based on user input.

EMI = \frac{P \times R \times (1 + R)^N}{(1 + R)^N - 1}
\]

Where:

- `P` = Principal loan amount  
- `R` = Monthly interest rate = Annual Rate / 12 / 100  
- `N` = Loan tenure in months = Years × 12
